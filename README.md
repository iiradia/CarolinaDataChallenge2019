# CarolinaDataChallenge2019
I worked with AKM Zubair Siam, Sam Galloway, and Alaina Randolph over a 24-hour period on analyzing crime data from the city of Chapel Hill, NC. 

This repo contains code and data analysis for our team's submission at the Carolina Data Challenge in October 2019. 
We took **2nd place** in the Beginner Division.
